title: "Recovering from De Quervain's Tenosynovitis"

From mid 2020 through late 2021 or early 2022 I suffered from a bad case of De Quervain's tenosynovitis in my left wrist. I experimented with many treatment options, and ultimatley found success with a physical therapy protocol aimed at building

* eccentric strength in the hand (i.e. opening the fist)
* concentric strength in the hand (i.e. grippers)
* full-body strength training (heavy 3x5 linear progression on key compound lifts like squats, deadlifts, barbell row, and overhead press - and at the beginning, overhead press was comparatively light due to wrist tenderness)

Overall I was surprised and frustrated by how limited it seemed that research had been into the relative effectiveness of various treatments for De Quervain's. At the time there seemed to be some evidence in the literature suggesting that steroid injections were *not* effective in the long run, but no positive evidence available for any approach as a viable path to long-term symptom relief. Ultimately I motivated the protocol for myself based on the literature available for other types of tendonitis.

This is not medical advice. I'm just documenting a course of action that happened to work for me, to add to the available body of evidence.

Here is what I recently wrote up for a friend who asked about my experience.

"""
I used the IronMind "expand-your-hand" progressively weighted elastic bands and IronMind "captains of crush" hand grippers to train eccentric and concentric contraction, respectively.

My protocol:

Start with massaging the wrist and working towards being able to open and close hand without pain. Work up to like 3 “sets” of 10 reps with short breaks between. Maybe once per day, or every other day. After a couple of weeks you should get to the point where, after you’re warmed up, it’s not miserable (to be clear, opening your hand while cold will still hurt). 

Then, progress to the lightest bands in the set. Always warm yourself up before using the bands. Slow, controlled movements at the heaviest tension you can tolerate without getting a “pop”. Once you can do 3x8-10 at one tension, move up to the next. Again, every day or every other day.

Then, maybe it’s my superstition but I felt it was beneficial to simultaneously train hand-closing. Again, these should feel “heavy” (most grippers people can do like 30 times without getting fatigued. You need a pair resistant enough that you can barely finish five).

In general, with both the hand extensions and hand contractions, high reps with low tension is a waste of time, but of course, “max tension” for hand opening will likely be 0 for the first couple of weeks because it’ll be all you can handle to slowly open and close your fingers, and that only after massage and gradual, gradual warm up.

Finally, I think it can’t hurt to try simultaneously doing linear progression 3x5 barbell squats 3 times per week. Linear progression is that you start with a reasonably heavy weight and add 2.5lbs to each side every workout until you can’t. I think this is important as it causes hormonal signaling for your body to repair itself, and nothing will do that more than heavy squats, deadlifts, and bench press. If you decide to add this part to the overall PT routine then of course also make sure you’re taking care of core strength by adding in some form of ab/oblique work.

Godspeed. I had this for two years during Covid with absolutely zero improvement until I got the bands and simultaneously got back in the gym. Online it’s very hard to find anyone who has gotten better. But once I started the above it went from “as bad as it ever was or worse” to “essentially a nonissue” in 2-3 months. To this day I can still occasionally (every few months) feel there’s something slightly off with that wrist but I haven’t felt “pain/weakness” in the wrist since 2022.

My approach was basically motivated by some fairly convincing study about volleyball players recovering from knee injuries. Large sample, all tendon strains. Various treatment groups randomly assigned. The only group that got better at long term follow up was the high weight low rep group. Similarly I don’t think there’s a single article that shows steroid injections having any benefit beyond pain reduction in the first few months. Some evidence that it’s anticorrelated with long run positive outcomes.
