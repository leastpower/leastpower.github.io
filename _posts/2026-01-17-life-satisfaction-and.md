It's aspirational that you'd be respected by those around you. it's harder than you'd think to achieve this - as you move up social classes your peer group happens to become more wealther. But another dynamic is that as you move up, payouts become more right skewed - among high earners in America, it's common to know people with net worths 10x-1000x greater than yours - so you somehow become even lower status among your peers than you were before in terms of distance to average peer wealth. Additionally, all of america might be moving this way as the internet makes it feel like only the globally impressive is actually impressive.
