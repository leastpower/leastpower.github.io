As LLMS become more powerful, the exercise of writing out your thoughts, learnings, and to-dos will be no less imporant. But the value added by complex note-taking and productivity systems is becoming less clear. 

I don't have much novel to add in terms of why one should be writing things down. For transactional knowledge like to-do lists and appointment times - things not valuable to memorize - writing them down gives you the freedom to forget. For factual knowledge and generative knowledge, the act of writing or typing can reinforce new learnings, and by refrencing them later you can draw connections and reaquaint yourself with a topic after are long interval. I don't think LLMs change any of the value proposition here.

Adopting organization systems for your notes impose a cost to storing new bits of information. The purpose, like indexing in an electronic database, is to make the information more legible to you later. It's not clear whether the exercise of indexing has merits of its own, but it definitely takes time, and introducing a fixed cost per note will mean not every note is "worth it", cutting down on how much you can ultimately record. 

Thankfully, LLM agents are designed to deal with gross volumes of unstructured text. As a result, even if you stored every note you take this year as a crumpled bit of paper in a dresser drawer, you should soon have the tools to extract structured insights with from that with little overhead.

On this blog in general I want to consider the minimum complexity tools for any task in life.  Moving into 2026 I think the answer for a wide range of personal note taking tasks will be simply a file folder and a bunch of markdown files. Even better if this dump of markdown files can be synchronized across devices - for example, I have a laptop, ipad, iphone, and supernote tablet. Each should be pointed to a common directory, say on a network storage device, and there's just one folder full of markdown files with git or some other tool to track changes running automatically on a regular cadence. Create a new markdown at any time, append to a markdown file at any time. Do whatever you want. It can all - including full history and timestamped changes - be processed offline by an LLM to 'index' the information usefully.
